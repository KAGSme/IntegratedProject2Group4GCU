Integrated Project 2 2015
Group 4
Programmers: Kieran Gallagher, Ricardo Barros

The game is optimised for multitouch devices such as android tablets with a preferable screen size of 7"+
so we can only provide an android build for now. The .APK File included can be easily installed on an android device
(with 4.4 and above, older versions of OS not tested) by:
1.	Transfer .APK file from a windows pc to the tablet storage(connected via USB).
2.	Use a file explorer on the android device and search for the .apk file.
3.	tapping the .apk file should initiate the android package installer prompting the user for  input
(to install the game, the setting allowing apps of unknown origin to be installed may have to be changed beforehand).

The game should be portable to IOS devices with no issue though this will require a new build from the unity project
